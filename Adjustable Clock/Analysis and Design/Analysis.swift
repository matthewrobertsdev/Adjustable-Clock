 clock resize
 important to get label sizes right, so long as fit width and height
 clock resizes to fit width & proportional height
    --individual labels have max width
    --labels as a whole have a height that is less than a proportion of window width
      or less than screen height if that is bigger
    --clock makes a proportional to width for a given supported format
    --right now just have one format for time and one for date
    --called by one master function
 window adapts to clock
    --called by one master function
 
 live resize
 
 regular resize
    clock will get smaller if too big for screen
    will get 90% width untill fits on screen
    so will keep shrinking until fits
    labels will keep fitting width
    will be called in every clock resize
 
 possibilty for live resize
    resizes bigger
        if already if full screen, will prompt normal shrinking
    resizes to fit
        fits right off the bat
        will need to never require being below minimum font?
 
 class that fufills protocol
